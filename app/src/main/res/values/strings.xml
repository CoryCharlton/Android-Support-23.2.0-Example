To fix issue #201851 the PNGs are no longer generate which should be fine because we can wrap a vector in another drawable as shown in the headers above.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately wrapping the vectors in a layer-list does not work for the notification as show by the buttons below (only #2 and #4 should work on pre-lollipop devices, #3 is and invalid drawable I believe [was throwing darts]).</string>
